# Task: Fix Android App Upgrade Signature Mismatch
Context: Android emulator requires uninstalling previous versions before installing the new version due to varying debug signatures generated by CI/CD.
Strategy: Implement `signingConfigs` for `release` in `build.gradle.kts` to use environment variables (`KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, etc.) or fallback to `key.properties`. Update GitHub Actions CI workflow to inject these secrets.

## Phased Checklist
- [x] Identify the root cause (ephemeral GitHub Actions runner generating new debug.keystore headers every build).
- [x] Modify `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to allow reading release keystore from properties or environment vars.
- [x] Update `.github/workflows/ci.yml` to support injecting keystore parameters into `flutter build apk/appbundle` commands from GitHub Secrets.
- [x] Create documentation detailing how to generate a keystore and add to GitHub Secrets.
